# Conditional Statements

## if 

```
if(comparision/expression){
    statements to be executed if comparision or expression evaluates to non zero;
}


```

## if - else

```
if(comparision/expression){
    statements to be executed if comparision or expression evaluates to non zero;
}
else{
    statements to be executed if comparision or expression evaluates to zero;
}
```


## nested if
```
    if(condition1){
        if(condition2){
            statements to execute when both conditions 1 & 2 evaluate to true;
        }
    }


```



##  else if ladder

used to check an hierarchy of conditions

```
if(cond/expr){
    statements;
}
else if(condition to check if above conditions evaluate to false)
{
    statements;
}
else if{
    statements;
}
.
. 
.
else{
    this statements get executed when all the conditions evaluate to false;
